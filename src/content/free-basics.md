    Free Basics of not about connecting people, it is about making a better buisness around the un-connected.
    
    Note:
        - Already a billion people buisness, now targeting 2 billion more... 
        - Free Basics is about keeping it partners free to access.
        - Internet would become like DTH services.
        - crores of money spent on ads, is that really charity ?

    But people move to the actual internet from Free Basics 
    
    Note:
        - the cost of the actual internet when the existing infra in invested on free basics
        - the monopoly of the telecos over a few
        - the way people think dosent grow to the un-connected
        - the control over the data
        - Research from prof.Vishal Mishra from columbia university "Zero rating do not actually help gorw the internet"
