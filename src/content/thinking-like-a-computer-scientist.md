	What does a computer do ?

	====

	** What does any program basically do ? **

	- Input <!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="1" -->
	- Output <!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="2" -->
	- Control Flow <!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="3" -->
	- Repetation <!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="4" -->
	- Data Manipulation <!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="5" -->

	====

	Lets Solve some problems ...!

	====

	** The Fizz Buzz Problem. **

	> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

	====

	** Water Tank Problem **

	> Write a robot that will fill the watertank whenever it is empty.

	====

	** A Birthday Manager **

	> Lets write a Birthday manager of our own.

	====

	** Before Coding ? **

	- Thinking of a solution before coding. <!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="1" -->
	- Logic 	<!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="2" -->
	- Write psuedo code	<!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="3" -->
	- Execute the psuedo code	<!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="4" -->
	- Validate all conditions. (Example : while loops and for loops.)	<!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="5" -->
	- Now write code in the computer. <!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="6" -->

	====

	** Errors and Debugging **

	Programming is error-prone.
	- Syntax errors
	- Runtime errors
	- Semantic errors
	- Experimental debugging

	====

	** Optimization **

	====

	** Readibility / Comments **

	a = 4 # Declaring value of a to 4  <!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="1" -->

	car_no_of_wheels = 4 # No of wheels of a car  <!-- .element: class="fragment" " data-fragment-index="2" -->

	====

	As a college student,  what can programming solve for me ?

	What can I do with programming ?
